                    <p>Checkers is a board game played between two players, who alternate moves. The player who cannot move, because he has no pieces, or because all of his pieces are blocked, loses the game.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Moving: A piece which is not a king can move one square, diagonally, forward. A king can move diagonally, forward or backward. A piece (piece or king) can only move to a vacant square. A move can also consist of one or more jumps (next paragraph).</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Jumping: You capture an opponent's piece by jumping over it, diagonally, to the adjacent vacant square beyond it. A king can jump diagonally, forward or backward. A piece which is not a king, can only jump diagonally forward.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Kinging: When a piece reaches the last row (the King Row), it becomes a King. A second checker is place on top of that one, by the opponent. A piece that has just kinged, cannot continue jumping pieces, until the next move.</p>
